# Project Vision

This is the Windows PowerPoint Add-in for arsnova.click and arsnova.voting und supports out of the box using of those apps without leaving PowerPoint or learning new graphihcal user interfaces.

# Getting started

To run the PowerPoint Integration, a Windows operating system with an already installed version of Office 2003 or newer is required.

# Development

Our application is developed using the [Visual Studio Tools For Office](https://www.visualstudio.com/de/vs/office-tools/) and C# .NET. To creating a new setup, Visual Studio is required (and recommended for development, too).

# Build & Deploy

Currently, there is no build job for this project because of a missing windows server. We're on it and will change this text if the build job is up and running.
